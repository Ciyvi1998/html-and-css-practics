                Unlike your everyday cuppa. <b>VAHDAM</b> teas do not travel in containers for months before
                being packaged and sold. All our teas are procured directly from plantations & tea
                growers within 24-72 hours of production, packaged garden fresh and shipped directly
                from source in India.
            </p>
            <p>
                By controlling the entire supply chain and cutting out all middlemen in the otherwise
                long & complication supply chain of the $60 billion tea industry, we are able to make
                available a fresher higher quality product at a lower price to consumers, fastest.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are also able to cut down delivery timeline from 3-9 months to less than a week.
                By setting up sourcing centres in India (already set-up), China & Sri Lanka, which
                account for 90% of the quality tea production in the world, with a global hub in
                Dubai/Singapore, VAHDAM endeavours to capture 5% entire world tea market in the next 7-10
                years and create a vertically integrated global tea brand.
