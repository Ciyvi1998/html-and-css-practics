                IFTTT empowers people to do more with the services they love. We work with over 360 apps, services, and
                devices including Facebook, Twitter, Philips Hue, Dropbox, Google, Nest, FItbit, BMW, and Slack, with
                Applets.
            </p>
            <p>
                Applets bring these services together to create new experiences of all types, from automating simple
                tasks to transforming how someone interacts with and controls their home. We believe creative control
                of the services we use should be intuitive and accessible to everyone. IFTTT is VC funded, and every
                year over 100 new services join the platform.
